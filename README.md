# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Jordan!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [ClassMatch](https://github.com/Hypercoded/classmatch), as a school-wide class directory, to see who shares what periods and teachers with you.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡ A bit about me: I'm a rising junior in HS and my hobbies include programming/video editing! 



ðŸŒ± I'm currently trying to improve my extracurriculars for school, if there's an open-source project you think I'd enjoy working on, let me know!
